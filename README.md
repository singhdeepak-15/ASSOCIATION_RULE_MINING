# ASSOCIATION_RULE_MINING
Association rule mining using Meta-Heuristic

run Project.m file (GUI based)

select population size 
leave diamension 
select iterations

select the dataset 'XLMINER' and press generate

the three algorithms are 
1. genetic algorithm
2. particle swarm optimization 
3. Hybrid (PSO with crossover operator)

the detail methodology of the tool can be reffered from
Sarath, K. N. V. D., and Vadlamani Ravi. "Association rule mining using binary particle swarm optimization." Engineering Applications of Artificial Intelligence 26.8 (2013): 1832-1840.
